  This is a breaking change.
  Feature-wise, it is the same as before.
  We will enable better customization by passing `viewport` to the `customizeSnapshotId` function in the future.

- [#204](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/pull/204) [`76b09cc`](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/commit/76b09cc00c5fc94026e2a5ab6283300325716675) Thanks [@unional](https://github.com/unional)! - Add support to customize `snapshotRootDir` with a function.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#162](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/pull/162) [`995140f`](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/commit/995140f0bda8c389a24f143f744dabe6d682a8ce) Thanks [@unional](https://github.com/unional)! - Support customizing `platform` by @joekrump.

  For example, with `vis({ platform: 'ci' })`,
  Instead of saving the snapshots to `<root>/__vis__/{local or process.platform}`,
  the snapshots will be saved to `<root>/__vis__/ci`.

### Patch Changes

- [#156](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/pull/156) [`72959a6`](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/commit/72959a6bd2bea3d9c1cff652b8ff384c10e017f2) Thanks [@unional](https://github.com/unional)! - Add top level `types` field to `package.json` for project not using ESM module resolution.

- [#160](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/pull/160) [`d2fdcbe`](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/commit/d2fdcbe023917ea9dc85ac332dfd8b46f6936f20) Thanks [@unional](https://github.com/unional)! - Remove `expectToFail` from `VisOptions`.
  It should not have that property.

- [#161](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/pull/161) [`43fc2ce`](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/commit/43fc2ce3385c0086de567816a1a1328ea4df336f) Thanks [@unional](https://github.com/unional)! - Change default timeout to 30s.
  The initial timeout of 1s was set by Vitest.
  It is causing tests to fail with `TimeoutError`,
  even when getting `Locator` like `getByRole`.

  This timeout will be removed in Vitest 3.

  The underlying provider (`playwright`) does not have a default timeout.

  Setting to 30s should be a good default for most cases.

  It could still be too short for slow CI or when it is running scripts in parallel.
  That was the case for `storybook-test-runner` but could be improved in Vitest browser mode.

  If timeout is still an issue, we can further default it to 60s or even 120s.

- [#158](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/pull/158) [`a020417`](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/commit/a02041770b32ca52baa35326ff77a39fe4b249c2) Thanks [@unional](https://github.com/unional)! - Add a blank line to separate the theme error messages.

  This is useful to test where the visual should be changed beyond the threshold.

- [#144](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/pull/144) [`f642dbf`](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/commit/f642dbfbb6a715ef14a944c50e656b79c926b5d4) Thanks [@unional](https://github.com/unional)! - Change `import { matchImageSnapshot } from 'vitest-plugin-vis/client'` to `import { imageSnapshotMatcher } from 'vitest-plugin-vis/client'`.

  This is a bug in 1.2.0 because `matchImageSnapshot` is hard loading `@vitest/browser/context`, which causes storybook to fail to load.

### Patch Changes

- [#144](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/pull/144) [`2d4f1c0`](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/commit/2d4f1c02394ca4fd8880452a98399c825e686ee5) Thanks [@unional](https://github.com/unional)! - Extends `expect` and `page` in presets.

  ```json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "types": ["vitest-plugin-vis"]
    }
  }
  ```

- [#133](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/pull/133) [`badf227`](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/commit/badf2273828ad883763e1e328b4e180c07b4960a) Thanks [@unional](https://github.com/unional)! - Perform image comparison on the client side.
  This is similar to `storybook-addon-vis@0.13.0`, but the image taking is still done on the server side.

  Try to address the issue of the slower image comparison on the server side.

  Export `matchImageSnapshot` function on the client side.
  Mark `parseImageSnapshotSubject` as deprecated as it is not needed anymore.

### Patch Changes

- [#136](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/pull/136) [`176d28f`](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/commit/176d28fc459cb0823f3fda94ad4e3372690dbd8d) Thanks [@unional](https://github.com/unional)! - Update error message during threshold conversion.

## 1.0.5

### Patch Changes

- [#130](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/pull/130) [`e242444`](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/commit/e242444908766274014b5fc94afaf31392627c88) Thanks [@unional](https://github.com/unional)! - Add update snapshot back to the server implementation.

  This should be safe because the image is generated by the browser, or it is a base64 string (not 100% sure on this), and the CRC is not used for anything.

  If not performance improvement is seen, we can revert this change.

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- [#123](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/pull/123) [`a8fcd75`](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/commit/a8fcd75a056cb5b16006c52190453f19e41ab182) Thanks [@unional](https://github.com/unional)! - Avoid resizing images when not necessary.
